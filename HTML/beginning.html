        <!-- This initial commit remarks the starting of my 2024's coding journey, in which my goals are:
        <ol>
            <li>Learn MERN Stack with REST APIs</li>
            <li>Learn Python comprehensively (i.e. Web Frameworks, Data Science, AI etc.)</li>
            <li>Continue Developing Games in Unity Game Engine</li>
        </ol>
        <br/> -->
        This is the track list of work done in this course. <br> 
        This document will contain my daily progress record, for this course only. For other courses, I'll make separate documents in their respective repository.

            <h4>3. How does Internet Work?</h4>
            <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>Internet:</b> An interconnection of thousands of computers across the globe</li>
            <li><b>Client-Server Model:</b> Whenever a computer(client) makes a request to access a webpage (for instance: <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>), it sends request to ISP (the internet provider company that allows you to use/access internet), which locates the domain name in DNS (Domain Name Server, acts as a phonebook), which then redirects the request to Server(A Large SuperComputer that acts as the library of webpages) which then returns the requested data to client computer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>4. How Website Works</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Browser:</b> It is a window/application that helps us to use Internet. For Example: Chrome, Edge, FireFox etc. <br>
                Whenever a client makes request to server for a website, the server sends a set of files consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br/>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>HTML: </b>Hypertext Markup Language, serves as structuring the website. i.e: The Text we see on web pages.</li>
                    <li><b>CSS: </b> Cascading Style Sheet, serves in styling the webpages and make websites attractive. i.e: Apply Fonts to text or colors to buttons etc.</li>
                    <li><b>JavaScript: </b>A Programming Language, that serves in the functionality of the website. i.e: making the Buttons or other Components to respond the way we want.</li>
                </ol>    
            </li>
